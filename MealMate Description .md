# MealMate - Database
Develop a comprehensive database schema using MySQL to model the various entities and relationships involved in the online food ordering system, including user accounts, restaurants, menus, orders, payments, and delivery tracking.

Define the Project Scope: Clearly outline the requirements and functionalities of the online food ordering system. Determine what features are essential for both customers and restaurant staff.

Database Design:

Identify Entities: Analyze the system to identify the main entities. In this case, entities like customer, menu, orders, payment, payment_details, and restaurant are evident.
Define Relationships: Determine how these entities relate to each other. For example, an order is associated with a customer and a menu item, while a payment is linked to an order.
Normalize the Database: Ensure the database design follows normalization rules to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.
Create Database and Tables:

Use SQL commands to create the necessary database (FOODHUNTZ) and tables (customer, menu, orders, payment, payment_details, and restaurant).
Define appropriate column names, data types, and constraints for each table.
Populate Tables with Sample Data:

Insert sample data into the tables using SQL INSERT statements. This data will be used for testing and demonstration purposes.
Implement Business Logic:

Define the business logic for the system, such as how orders are processed, how payments are confirmed, and how customer and restaurant interactions are managed.
This may involve writing stored procedures, triggers, or application code to handle various scenarios.
Testing:

Test the functionality of the system to ensure it behaves as expected.
Perform unit tests for individual components as well as integration tests to verify interactions between different modules.
Address any issues or bugs discovered during testing.
Deployment:

Deploy the system to a production environment where it can be accessed by users.
Ensure proper configuration and security measures are in place to protect sensitive data.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Monitor the system's performance and usage to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
Perform regular maintenance tasks such as database backups, software updates, and security patches.
User Training and Support:

Provide training to users (both customers and restaurant staff) on how to use the system effectively.
Offer ongoing support to address any questions or concerns users may have.
Iterative Improvement:

Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
Continuously iterate on the system by adding new features, optimizing existing functionality, and addressing user feedback.
